# Parking Lot

Parking Lot Simulator Project

- The project was done for Data Structures and Algorithms class of Fall 2025
- The project models a Parking Lot and its functions, using basic data structures and algorithms
- Includes implementation of Stack and Queue
- Time Complexities for each operation is commented
- Written in `C++`
- The project is comprised of the following features:
  1. Entrance Queue: Cars enter in FIFO order
  2. Parking Lanes (Stacks): Implemented using Linked Lists
  3. Parking Lot: An array of these stack-based lanes
  4. Algorithms to operate over the given Data Structures
